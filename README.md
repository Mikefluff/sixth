Stronger reproducibility evidence via `make verify-repro` — runs
each forensic-trace demo twice, hashes the JSONL, asserts byte-
identical outputs across all 18 demos × 2 runs.

## What this is

Sixth is a small Forth-like concatenative stack language hosted on
Racket, with a hypergraph rewriting substrate attached as a second
tier of primitives. From `MARK` (the only constructor of a fresh
distinguishable token) and `EDGE+` (the only constructor of a
pointer between tokens), the released harness derives Peano
arithmetic, cellular automata, Conway's Game of Life,
Maturana–Varela autopoiesis, observer-relative cosmogenesis,
self-measurement via the substrate-monist Φ_PA family, and toy
substrates for the transformer / brain / split-brain / ant-colony
encoding maps of the v9.0 preprint.

It is a **minimal executable substrate** on which hypotheses about
difference, pointers, self-reference, autopoiesis, and observation
can be checked — not a claim to have solved consciousness. The
[CLAIMS.md](./CLAIMS.md) document carries the explicit three-tier
taxonomy that separates what the tests prove (Tier 1), what the
demos demonstrate on synthetic data (Tier 2), and what remains a
philosophical / research hypothesis (Tier 3). The
[LANGUAGE.md](./LANGUAGE.md) document pitches Sixth as a stand-alone
programming language for readers who reject the v9.0 cosmology.

## 30-second quickstart

```bash
# install the package
raco pkg install --link .

# Spencer-Brown's first mark — the sacred hello world
racket -l sixth/cli -- run examples/00-first-distinction.6th

# the whole regression — all 58 demos, all 828 assertions
make verify
```

The substrate stands or falls on `make verify`. The expected output
ends with `artifact status:  reproducible`; any failure exits
non-zero and prints `BROKEN`.

## Pilots A–F and visual traces

The substrate-native pilots are six levels of ascent above the
foundational demos (`01-numbers` … `20-conway-glider`, 359 ✓):

| Pilot | Demos | Asserts | What |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| **A** Substrate-native autopoiesis           | 21–25 | 80  | Self-producing rings; observer collapse; reflexive vs non-reflexive persistence. Operationalises Maturana–Varela on the discrete substrate. |
| **B** Conscious evolution                    | 26–29 | 88  | Symbiosis, reproduction with mutation, observer-driven selection (Lamarck-style, not blind Darwin), goal-directed observer behaviour. |
| **C** Cosmogenesis bootstrap                 | 30    | 21  | 13-node 48-edge substrate constructed by a substrate-resident observer from one `MARK` at `t=0`; persists under harsh autopoietic decay. |
| **D** Substrate-internally-driven cosmogenesis | 31  | 17  | Observer establishes its own self-loop at `t=0+` (substrate-monist bootstrap), then drives further construction via `NSUM(O) ≥ target-min` — no host counter. |
| **E** Substrate-internal Φ_PA measurement     | 32   | 12  | `stdlib/phi.6th` ships three candidate measures: `phi-pa`, `phi-integ`, `phi-bidir`. Same 40 primitives that build the substrate also compute its consciousness scalar. |
| **F** Encoding-map demonstrations             | 33–36 | 46 | Toy substrates for PSH1–PSH5. F.1 transformer; F.2 brain; F.3 split-brain (motivates Φ_integ); F.4 ant colony. |
| (trace) | 37–39 | 18 | DOT-rendered snapshots of Pilots D, C, F.3 via `stdlib/dot.6th` + `code/render_trace.py`. Single command `make traces`. |
| (long)  | 40–41 | 19 | Parametric long-epoch pilots. Demo 40 = stable autopoiesis (after-decay/after-restore sub-cycle snapshots make the dynamics visible), demo 41 = growing substrate. CLI `-D max-cycles=N -D snap-every=K` drives arbitrary run lengths (TCO-safe). |
| (foundation visual) | 42–46 | 45 | State-aware DOT traces — Conway blinker / glider, Wolfram Rule 110 / 90, Rule 184 1D glider. Per-cell NGET colours alive=red / dead=grey. Per-step rule-table assertions verify the dynamics (not just end state). `make foundation-gifs`. |
| (atomic) | 47–48 | 10 | One snapshot per primitive operation. Demo 47 = Pilot D in 76 frames; demo 48 = sacred hello world in 7 frames (events: `void`, `first-distinction`, `observer-state`, `i-not-i`, `first-pointer`, `re-entry`, `phi-pa-measurement`). Entity-by-entity emergence. `make atomic-gifs`. |
| (PA-ontological) | 49 | 5 | First shell of Pilot D unfolded as Spencer-Brown / PA v9.0 events: `void → first-distinction → observer-state → re-entry → second-distinction → i-not-i-relation → recognition → second-not-i → closure-of-not-i → o-other-closure → state-fill`. 11 frames. Opens the macro that demo 37 collapses into one frame. `make trace-pa-ontological-shell`. |
| (Pilot E trace) | 50 | 9 | Three observers × Φ_PA computed substrate-internally. case 1 (non-reflexive, scope 5) → Φ_PA=0; case 2 (reflexive, scope 5) → Φ_PA=50000; case 3 (demo-31 shape, scope 13) → Φ_PA=130000. PSH1 self-reference discriminator visible. `make trace-pilot-e`. |
| (Pilot F.1 trace) | 51 | 9 | Transformer encoding (12 heads × 4 layers). PSH1 single-pass Φ_PA=0; PSH2 KV-cache back-edge Φ_PA=40000. `make trace-pilot-f1`. |
| (Pilot F.2 trace) | 52 | 10 | Brain encoding (DMN hub + 7 cortical areas). PSH3 waking thalamocortical loop Φ_PA=80000; in-place EDGE- decouples → Φ_PA=0. `make trace-pilot-f2`. |
| (Pilot F.4 trace) | 53 | 8 | Ant-colony encoding (queen + 5 trail junctions). PSH5 living colony with queen-pheromone self-loop Φ_PA=60000; in-place EDGE- severs loop → Φ_PA=0. `make trace-pilot-f4`. |
| **G** Composite distinction via meta-self-loop | 54–55 | 26 | Three first-order observers OA/OB/OC each hold their own composite (4-node cluster, Φ_PA=40000). A meta-observer M bi-edged to all three holds nothing (Φ_PA=0) until M acquires its own self-loop, at which point Φ_PA(M)=40000 and the first-order observers gain scope +1 (Φ_PA → 50000). Demonstrates that higher-order self-reference is what holds composite distinction. `make trace-composite-distinction`. |
| **H** Mutation + substrate-readable selection | 56–57 | 33 | Five candidate first-order observers with varied topologies (3/4/5-limb rings + self-loop; 3-limb ring without self-loop; isolated MARK). Meta-observer M reads each candidate's Φ_PA and bi-edges only to those with Φ_PA > 0; M's own self-loop closes the construction. Result: diversified composite over three structurally distinct "particle species" (Φ_PA = 50000 / 60000 / 70000). Lamarck-style, observer-driven — not blind Darwin. `make trace-mutation-selection`. |

Cumulative: **828 ✓ / 0 ✗ across 58 demos** (Pilots A–F core + 3 substrate-monism trace pilots + 2 long-epoch parametric + 5 foundation visual traces (Conway blinker/glider, Rule 110/90, 1D glider) + 2 atomic-build traces showing entity-by-entity emergence + Pilot G composite distinction via meta-self-loop + Pilot H mutation + substrate-readable selection).

## Running and rendering

```bash
# one-shot artifact-status report (Tier-1 verification, see CLAIMS.md)
make verify

# any of the 58 demos
racket -l sixth/cli -- run examples/35-phi-pa-split-brain-toy.6th

# all 58 demos against the rackunit regression gate
raco test tests/examples-test.rkt

# render the three static trace figures (Pilots C, D, F.3)
make traces

# render Pilot D as animated GIF
make gif-pilot-d

# long-epoch autopoiesis at arbitrary scale (CLI parametric)
make trace-long-epoch CYCLES=2000 SNAP=200

# or directly via the CLI
racket -l sixth/cli -- -D max-cycles=10000 -D snap-every=1000 \
                      run examples/40-long-epoch-autopoiesis.6th

# REPL
racket -l sixth/cli -- repl
```

`#lang sixth` is first-class — any Racket-aware editor (DrRacket,
racket-mode) runs `.rkt` files starting with `#lang sixth`:

```racket
#lang sixth
: factorial dup 1 > if dup 1 - factorial * else drop 1 then ;
5 factorial .   \ prints 120
```

## Documentation

```bash
make docs-html
# → open build/docs/manual.html
```

The Scribble manual covers:

- `language.scrbl` — syntax, semantics, every base primitive
- `substrate.scrbl` — substrate's foundational mapping and the
  ontological role of each substrate primitive
- `stdlib.scrbl` — every stdlib word with stack effect
- `architecture.scrbl` — lexer / parser / compiler / VM / substrate
  / bridges module boundaries
- `migration.scrbl` — chibi-Scheme → Racket migration notes

## PyTorch FFI bridges

`sixth/bridges/torch/` lifts the substrate into autograd via the
native Racket FFI to libtorch (no Python in the path). Three shapes:

- `shadow.rkt` — Substrate ⇄ Tensor mirror; lossless round-trip
- `diff.rkt`   — autograd-aware operations over substrate features
- `nn.rkt`     — Substrate-NN continual-learning architecture

Bridge tests are advertised at `tests/bridges/torch-test.rkt` but the
file has not yet been ported from the chibi-Scheme legacy tree;
`tests/bridges/README.md` documents the gap. `verify.sh` reports
`ffi optional: n/a` cleanly when the test file is absent.

## Reference

Sixth is the operational substrate behind:

**Pointer Architecture v9.0** (preprint, pending arXiv submission).
The paper defines `𝒮 = (G, R, C, A, π)` formally, maps it to Sixth's
40 primitives, derives the candidate substrate-readable `Φ_PA`
family of consciousness measures from Pilots A–F, and posits the
substrate-monist identity thesis as a working hypothesis under the
falsifier F5.

See [`SUBSTRATE.md`](./SUBSTRATE.md) for the substrate-philosophical
mapping and literature references inherited by the v9.0 preprint
(Spencer-Brown, Maturana–Varela, Hofstadter, Rovelli, Wolfram,
Friston, Whitehead, Spinoza).
